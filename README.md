# ASL Image Classifier 

A deep learning project that classifies American Sign Language (ASL) hand signs using a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) built in PyTorch. This model was trained on a labeled image dataset and achieves high accuracy across 36 ASL classes.

## Features

- Custom TinyVGG CNN architecture built from scratch in PyTorch  
- Trained on a dataset of over 5,000 labeled ASL images  
- Supports classification of letters A-Z and digits 0-9  
- Achieves ~98% test accuracy after 10 epochs  
- Includes data preprocessing with PyTorch `transforms` and `ImageFolder`  
- Simple training pipeline with modular code structure

## Tech Stack

- Python  
- PyTorch  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)  
- torchvision  
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
